        "content": "Is this really news?  5 million retweets in 1 hour already. Today on the internet something went viral for no good reason.  Austrlian man John Smith could not believe his eyes when he saw something on the internet. John immediately shared it with all his friends and colleagues who also could not believe their eyes. \r\n\r\n Psychologists say things go viral because they are so funny that we want to share them with the next person. Although not like coronavirus. The issue is, no one can predict what will and won't go viral.  Some people say simplicity, and others say relatability. James Currier of Tickle.com a psychology testing website believes there are eight psychological triggers that push people to share something.  These are status, identity, being helpful, fear, order, novelty, validation and voyerism. The fact is, no one really knows or cares.\r\n\r\nViral videos started back in the early 1990s when animated GIFs began circulating on the internet.  These GIFs were small enough to be sent as email attachments or uploaded to websites over dial-up internet.  Videos began to spread on file sharing sites, message boards and were even picked up on television.\r\n\r\nCarrot cake gummi bears sweet roll carrot cake macaroon donut sugar plum cake sweet.

        "content": "She Coders were amazed to learn today that a web page can actually be built by anyone, including themselves.  Not only that, but the She Coders would be building their own web page and also styling it with CSS.  At first the She Coders were aprehensive and not quite sure what this HyperText Markup Language was all about.\r\n\r\nLuckily, lead mentor Caitlin, along with the other mentors, Vivian, Lachlan and Sarah were there to calm the She Coders nerves and teach them the basics.\r\n\r\n We all come from different backgrounds and often have unique paths to getting where we are today. If you take the time to capitalize on that there is sure to be something new to learn from each other, whether it is writing new tests for a project or adhering to a style guide.  It's from these conversations that new appreciation for one another can be formed leading to new friendships or even mentors.\r\n\r\nLeaning to code is the new form of literacy.  So many of the things we interact with have been touched by code.  The more you can learn to code, the more interaction and impact you can have with the world around you.  In ther words, learning to code won't just give you technical knowledge - it will also give you a new way to approach both how you live and work.\r\n\r\nCoding is not only about programming, it is also about being able to use technology.  It is about learning how to build things and building them with the tools you have.  It is about making your own decisions and using what you have learned.  It is about being able to make mistakes and learn from them. And here's the thing.  I am a notorious quitter.  I am willing to try something new but if it impacts me negatively I am out of there.  I am happy to say I have tried it, and many times I try more than once. No matter how many times I have tried to teach myself to code.  I have never been able to keep at it long enough to make it stick."
